		// Map is a Interface which stores the value on the basis of Key and Value pair, key cannot be duplicated but value can be duplicated on the basis of which map u r using
		//HashTable(class) and HashMap(class) implements MapInterface
		//LinkedHashMap extends HashMap
		//SortedMap is an interface which is extending MapInterface
		//NavigableMap extends SortedMap
		//TreeMap implements NavigableMap
		//in excel key value pair is column names(name, address, email id etc are keys and their values are values)
		
		//examples of map-:
		//1. map of error codes and description(1.2.4, fatal error)

		//6. rest api map of content id and value or session id and value
	
		// methods put(used to add the value) putall (to insert map inside the map
		//get method (pass the key and get the value)
		// contains method if it contains that key the it return true otherwise false if key sirsa is there then it returns true else false
		//remove method on the basis of key(sirsa)
		//keyset gives the set view that what are the keys are available if u want to iterate
		//entryset returns the set view that what are the keys and values are available
